Minimum Operations to Make Strings Equal
=======================================

Explanation for Class 10 Students:

1. Problem Understanding:
- We have two strings (let's call them string1 and string2)
- We need to make them equal using minimum operations
- Allowed operations:
  * Delete any character from any string
  * Insert any character into any string

2. Simple Idea:
- Keep the common parts that are already matching
- Only modify the parts that don't match
- Minimum operations = (length of string1 - common parts) + (length of string2 - common parts)

How the Solution Works:
-----------------------
1. First we find the longest sequence of characters that appears in both strings in the same order (called LCS - Longest Common Subsequence)

2. Then we calculate:
   - Characters to delete from string1 = length of string1 - LCS length
   - Characters to add to string1 = length of string2 - LCS length
   - Total operations = sum of above two

Example Walkthrough:
-------------------
Let's take:
string1 = "sea" (length 3)
string2 = "eat" (length 3)

Step 1: Find common parts
- Common letters in order: 'e' and 'a' (LCS = "ea", length 2)

Step 2: Calculate operations
- From "sea":
  * Need to delete 's' (1 operation)
- To make it "eat":
  * Need to add 't' (1 operation)
- Total operations = 1 + 1 = 2

Time and Space Complexity:
-------------------------
Time: O(n×m) where:
- n = length of string1
- m = length of string2
(Because we check each character combination)

Space: O(n×m)
(Because we make a table of size n×m)

C++ Code Explanation:
--------------------
1. solve() function:
- Makes a table (2D array) to store common sequence lengths
- Fills the table by comparing characters:
  * If same: take diagonal value + 1
  * If different: take maximum of left or top value

2. minOperations() function:
- Uses solve() to get common length
- Applies the formula:
  (string1.length - common) + (string2.length - common)

Complete C++ Code:
-----------------
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int solve(string &s1, string &s2) {
        int n = s1.size();
        int m = s2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if(s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
    
    int minOperations(string &s1, string &s2) {
        int common = solve(s1, s2);
        return (s1.size() - common) + (s2.size() - common);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string s1 = "sea";
    string s2 = "eat";
    cout << "Minimum operations: " << sol.minOperations(s1, s2);
    return 0;
}
